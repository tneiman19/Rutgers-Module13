# Rutgers-Module13 ((ORM): E-Commerce Back End)

# Task

For this assignment, we were tasked with building the backend for an e-commerce site.   This application works with the Express.js API and the Sequelize library to interact with a MySQL database.

We needed to build the Models and API routes to be able to do the following: (For the Category, Products, and Product Tag Models)
- GET all (Categories, Products, or Tags)
- GET a category, product, or tag by its id.
- POST a category, product, or tag.
- PUT  a category, product, or tag by its id.
- DELETE  a category, product, or tag by its id.

# Additionally

Your walkthrough video should also show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Insomnia.

Below is a mockup tutorial of what this project should look like. 

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia:
